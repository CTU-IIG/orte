ORTE 0.3.4 Release Notes
========================

The major new feature of this release is Android support. See
README.android for details how to compile an Android demo application
included in ORTE. Besides that we tested ORTE on RTEMS, BlackBerry,
ReactOS and checked whether the Windows and FreeBSD builds still work.
