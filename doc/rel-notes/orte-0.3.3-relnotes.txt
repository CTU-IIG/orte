ORTE 0.3.3 Release Notes
========================

This is mostly a bugfix release. The last version was released almost
four years ago so it is definitely time for a new release. One big
change since the last release is that ORTE is no longer distributed as
a part of OCERA project. We created a new project at sourceforge
specifically for ORTE. With this change we also moved the source
repository from CVS to Git and created a new homepage.

This release does not contain Windows binaries. If you have trouble
compiling them from sources, let us know.
