  <para>The Open Real-Time Ethernet (ORTE) is open source implementation of
  RTPS communication protocol. RTPS is new application layer protocol
  targeted to real-time communication area, which is build on the top of
  standard UDP stack. Since there are many TCP/IP stack implementations
  under many operating systems and RTPS protocol does not have any other
  special HW/SW requirements, it should be easily ported to many HW/SW
  target platforms. Because it uses only UDP protocol, it retains control of
  timing and reliability.</para>
