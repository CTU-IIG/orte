Shape for Android
=================

Shape for Android is a demonstration application delivered with ORTE source code.

How to create shape_android.apk
-----------------------------
1] Update Android SDK to include last Android 5.0.1 (API 21)
<path-to-sdk>/tools/android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter android-21

2] Clone ORTE project from git
git clone git://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/orte
cd orte/orte

3] Update libaorte and shape_android projects
<path-to-sdk>/tools/android update project -p libaorte
<path-to-sdk>/tools/android update project -p contrib/shape_android -n orte_shape

4] Build libaorte
cd libaorte
<path-to-ndk>/ndk-build

5] Build shape_android
cd ../contrib/shape_android
ant debug

6] Install shape_android
<path-to-sdk>/platform-tools/adb install -r bin/orte_shape-debug.apk

!! Note that there is kind of problem with aapt for some architectures, when running
"ant debug" command. On my pc - 32bit, Debian GNU/Linux 7.8 (wheezy), the problem
was solved in directory <path-to-sdk>/build-tools/21.1.2 like this:

$mv aapt _aapt
$cat <<EOF > aapt
>#!/bin/bash
>qemu-i386 -cpu n270 -L / <path-to-sdk>/build-tools/21.1.2/_aapt $@
>EOF

It means that aapt is run in qemu. Build then was sucessful.
