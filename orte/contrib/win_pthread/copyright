 In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Red Hat permits programs

 Open Source definition to be linked with libcygwin.a without
 libcygwin.a itself causing the resulting program to be covered by the
 GNU GPL.

 This means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to
 cygwin, and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy
 of libcygwin.a linked into it.  Note that this does not apply to the
 cygwin DLL itself.  If you distribute a (possibly modified) version
 of the DLL you must adhere to the terms of the GPL, i.e. you must
 provide sources for the cygwin DLL.

 precise Open Source Definition referenced above.

 Red Hat sells a special Cygwin License for customers who are unable
 to provide their application in open source code form.  For more
