  	         ORTE - OCERA Real-Time Ethernet

The ORTE is open source implementation of RTPS communication protocol 
defined by Real Time Innovations (http://www.rti.com). 
RTPS is new application layer protocol targeted to real-time communication 
area, which is build on top of standard UDP stack.

Supported targets:
Linux
Windows - MinGW, MSVC
RTLinux - need to fix UDP (Miquele or Ismael Ripoll), call function bind 
with port 0, doesn't give any free port.

To build: 
simply untar instalation package into desired directory, enter this 
directory and issue following commands.

./configure
make 
make install

after this procedure ORTEManager and ORTEPing are placed in /usr/local/bin.

To start:
run :ORTEManager &
see :ORTEManager -h for usaged
note:ORTEManager have to run during all communication. For future work can 
be added into /etc/init.d/... script for starting ORTEManager during boot
of machine. This script (redhat and mandrake) is placed in 
"orte/manager/rc/ORTEManagerd"
For developping a RT application, ORTEManager can be running in userspace.
Start it with parameter "-k 192.168.4.2". This address is IP address of 
RT application.

To test communication:
in a shell try to type "ORTEPing -p -s". So, now will be created one publisher
and one subscriber with same topic and type. If you see messages like

[root@localhost ORTEPing]# ./ORTEPing -p -s
sent issue 1
received fresh issue 1
sent issue 2
received fresh issue 2
sent issue 3
received fresh issue 3

communication works. If you see only sending messsages, it's sign that ORTEManager 
is not probably running.
See "ORTEPing -h" for usaged.

Now, you can develop self applications (see documentation).

orders, etc. to the address below.
