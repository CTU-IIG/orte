    	            ORTE - OCERA Real-Time Ethernet
		    -------------------------------

What is it?
-----------
The ORTE is open source implementation of RTPS communication protocol 
defined by Real Time Innovations (http://www.rti.com). 
RTPS is new application layer protocol targeted to real-time communication 
area, which is build on top of standard UDP stack.

Which targets are supported by ORTE?
-----------------------------------
UNIX - Linux, Solars, MacOS, FreeBSD
Windows - MinGW, CygWin, MSVC, PharLap
RTLinux - with preliminary UDP stack
RTAI - with RTNet
JAVA

note: was tested on
sparc-sun-solaris2.9
powerpc-apple-darwin6.8

Obtaining CVS Code
------------------

This seems redundant, since if you're reading this you most likely have
already performed this step; however, for completeness, you can obtain
the ORTE source code via anonymous CVS from the Sourceforge
project <http://sf.org/projects/ocera/>:

  $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ocera login
  $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ocera co -P ocera/components/comm/eth/orte

Building From CVS
-----------------

To build ORTE from CVS, you will need Autoconf, Automake, 
and any tools that those utilities require (GNU m4, Perl,
etc.).  See the configure.in file to find the minimum versions of each
of these tools. 

After checking out the code, you will need to perform these steps to get
to the point where you can run "make".

 $ make -f Makefile.cvs 


How to make and install it?
---------------------------

simply untar instalation package into desired directory, enter this 
directory and issue following commands.

UserSpace compilation:
./configure
make 
make install

after this procedure ortemanager and orteping are placed in /usr/local/bin
, library in /usr/local/lib and include headers /usr/local/include

RTLinux compilation with wIP:
./configure --with-linux=/patched linux dir/ --with-rtlinux=/rtlinux dir/ --with-rtlinuxwip=/wip dir/
make 
make install

RTLinux compilation with onetd:
./configure --with-linux=/patched linux dir/ --with-rtlinux=/rtlinux dir/ --with-rtlinuxonetd=/onetd dir/
make 
make install

RTAI compilation:
./configure --with-linux=/patched linux dir/ --with-rtai=/rtai dir/ --with-rtnet=/rtnet dir/ 
make 
make install

JAVA compilation:
./configure --with-java=/java home dir/ 
make
make install

How to start?
-------------

run :ortemanager &
see :ortemanager -h for usage
note:ortemanager have to be running during all communication. For future work can 
be added into /etc/init.d/... script for starting ortemanager during boot
of machine. This scripts (redhat and mandrake) are located in 
"orte/manager/rc/ortemanagerd"
For developping a RT application, ortemnager can be running in userspace.
Start it with parameter "-k 192.168.4.2". This address is IP address of 
RT application.

How to test communication?
-------------------------

in a shell try to type "orteping -p -s". So, now will be created one publisher
and one subscriber with same topic and type. If you see messages like

[root@localhost ORTEPing]# ./orteping -p -s
sent issue 1
received fresh issue 1
sent issue 2
received fresh issue 2
sent issue 3
received fresh issue 3

communication works. If you see only sending messsages, it's sign that ortemanager 
is not probably running.
See "orteping -h" for usaged.

Now, you can develop self applications (see documentation).

orders, etc. to the address below.
